<p>You shall be solely responsible for the use of the Client Area accessed through your username and password and agree to indemnify SM against any claim, loss, cost, damage, action or expense suffered or incurred by SM as a result of the use of the Client Area accessed via your username and password or from your failure to comply with the terms of use and any supplemental terms agreed with you from time to time.</p>
